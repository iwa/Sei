# 清 Sei

Personal theme for Obsidian, designed with clarity and simplicity in mind.

## 📖 Introduction

**Sei is my personal Obsidian theme.** While I may add some customization options in the future, it might not quite fit your needs. Please keep that in mind :)

This theme began as a hard fork of the Cupertino theme, and has now almost been completely reworked.
Some elements have been kept pratically unchanged because the spirit Cupertino's author conveys is the closest to what I'm looking for in an Obsidian theme.<br/>
I'm always looking to make the "perfect theme" for me, incorporating many great features I used over the years with a lot of themes.

## 🛠️ Installation

Currently WIP, I might try to get the theme on the Obsidian store for convinience.
